# Dashboard Sync Notes

The dashboard can combine contract state with Horizon checks to show payout readiness.

## Recommended sync order

1. Read registered contributors from the contract.
2. Normalize GitHub usernames for display and filtering.
3. Query Horizon for funding, trustline, and reserve status.
4. Cache readiness results with a short TTL.
5. Re-check before payout export.

Contract verification proves the registry entry was approved; Horizon readiness proves the address can receive the selected asset.

## has_record lookup optimization (Wave #40)

`has_record(github_username) -> bool` is now exposed as a contract entry
point. Dashboard and indexer consumers that only need an existence check
(e.g. "is this username already registered?" during a form validation, or a
membership check while paging through webhook events) should call it instead
of `get_address`:

- `has_record` avoids deserializing the full `ContributorRecord`.
- `get_address` should still be used whenever the caller actually needs
  `stellar_address`, `registered_at`, or `verified`.

Tests for this behavior live alongside the contract in `src/lib.rs`
(`test_has_record_reflects_registration_state`) and `src/storage.rs`
(`test_has_record_true_after_set_record`).
